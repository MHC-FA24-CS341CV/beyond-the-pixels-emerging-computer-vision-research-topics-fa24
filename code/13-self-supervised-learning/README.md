# Analyzing Performance of SimCLR on Different Images

The SimCLR model used for this study was trained by [Chen et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.05709) on the [ImageNet ILSVRC-2012](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0575) dataset. This is a dataset comprised of images from 1,000 object classes for a total of ~1.28 million available images. These images span a wide range of different classes, making the SimCLR pre-trained model ideal as a generalized image classifier. 

## Test Datasets

The three example datasets used for testing come from [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/overview?hl=en). 
1. The [`tf_flowers`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/tf_flowers?hl=en) dataset is comprised of up-close images of flowers including sunflowers, dandelions, daisies, and tulips. 
2. The [`imagenette`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/imagenette?hl=en) dataset is a subset of the ImageNet dataset and contains 10 different classes. 
3. The final test dataset is [`cifar100`](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cifar100?hl=en) which consists of 100 classes and 20 superclasses. These images are significantly more blurred than that of the other two datasets. 

## Running the program

The code is designed to be run in Google Colab. Open the [`.ipynb file`](https://github.com/MHC-FA24-CS341CV/beyond-the-pixels-emerging-computer-vision-research-topics-fa24/blob/main/code/13-self-supervised-learning/Self_Supervised_Learning.ipynb) in colab and select `Runtime -> Run all`. The process should take around 10 minutes depending on your GPU. The outputted images display the modelsâ€™ predictions alongside the true labels.
