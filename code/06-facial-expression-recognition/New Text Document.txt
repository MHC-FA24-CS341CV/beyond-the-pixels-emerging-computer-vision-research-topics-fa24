# Facial Expression Recognition: Bias Detection Using Clustering

## Description
This project explores biases in facial expression recognition (FER) systems using the UTKFace dataset. 
By applying unsupervised clustering on extracted facial features, the analysis highlights racial imbalances in the dataset 
and demonstrates how these biases affect the representation of underrepresented groups, such as Black individuals. 
The project leverages K-Means clustering and the elbow method to determine optimal clusters and evaluates how 
facial features are distributed across these clusters.
